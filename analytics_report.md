- Dataset 24: 40.61% (+5.50% from previous) - renewed growth phase
- Dataset 25: 32.89% (-7.72% from previous) - sharp correction after peak
- Pattern significance: Demonstrates persistent oscillation with mean reversion after peaks - system alternates between highs (~40-42%) and corrections (~30-35%)

## 💡 Conclusions and Interpretation

### General Trends

1. **Strong cyclical pattern:** 60Percent values show clear cycles of growth, correction, and recovery
2. **Increased volatility:** Later datasets demonstrate larger fluctuations with oscillating behavior
3. **Oscillation with mean reversion:** System oscillates between ~30% and ~43%, with corrections following peaks
4. **Improved data quality:** Datasets 18-25 have high number of points (7-8 each)
5. **Resilience pattern:** System shows ability to recover from significant drops within 2-3 datasets
6. **Predictable corrections:** Sharp rises (+5-9%) are typically followed by corrections (-3-8%)

### Possible Causes of Changes

- **Game balancing:** Changes in difficulty or mechanics may affect achievability of certain results
- **Sample size:** Datasets with more data points (4-8) show more stable values
- **Seasonal changes:** Different periods may have had different conditions

### Recommendations

- **For forecasting:** Consider oscillation pattern with mean reversion - after peaks (~40-42%), expect corrections (5-8 points down)
- **For planning:** Consider range 30-43% with high volatility; expect alternating up/down movements
- **For analysis:** Special attention to datasets with extreme changes (14, 18-19, 21, 24-25)
- **Data quality:** Datasets 18-25 demonstrate advantages of more data points (7-8 each)
- **Pattern recognition:** Recent data (18-25) shows oscillating waves with corrections after peaks - useful for predicting future movements
