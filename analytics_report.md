- Quality: Maximum number of points among all datasets

## 🚀 Key Events

### Significant Changes (>5%)

1. **+7.02%** (dataset 4→5): First significant jump
2. **-4.89%** (dataset 10→11): Notable correction
3. **+11.27%** (dataset 13→14): Maximum growth for the period ⚡
4. **-7.23%** (dataset 14→15): Correction after peak

### Stability Periods

#### 📉 **Phase 5: New Drop (dataset 19)**

- Character: Sharp decline after growth period
- Value: 30.36% (-12.24% from previous)
- Feature: Largest drop over entire observation period

## 💡 Conclusions and Interpretation

### General Trends

1. **Cyclical trend:** 60Percent values show growth followed by corrections
2. **Increased volatility:** Later datasets demonstrate larger fluctuations
3. **New correction:** Dataset 19 shows possibility of significant declines
4. **Improved data quality:** Datasets 18-19 have maximum number of points (8)

### Possible Causes of Changes

- **Game balancing:** Changes in difficulty or mechanics may affect achievability of certain results
- **Sample size:** Datasets with more data points (4-6) show more stable values
- **Seasonal changes:** Different periods may have had different conditions

### Recommendations

- **For forecasting:** Consider cyclicality - growth periods are followed by corrections
- **For planning:** Consider range 30-45% with high volatility
- **For analysis:** Special attention to datasets with extreme changes (14, 19)
- **Data quality:** Datasets 18-19 demonstrate advantages of more data points
